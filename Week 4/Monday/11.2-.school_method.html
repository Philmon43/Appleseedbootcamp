            // teaches that subject and who is not in full capacity. If all ofthe teachers are in full capacity log to the console “Sorry,
            // no available teachers left”.


            //3. A method called “assignTeachersSubject” that takes two arguments, the teacher’s id, a new subject.

            //4. Create a new method of anything you want.
